# Egyptian Multiplication

The following project is a small exploration of the [Egyptian
multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_multiplication)
algorithm. The code was inspired by the [From Mathematics to Generic
Programming](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/2643027).

A non-recursive version using `foldl` was originally authored by Rodrigo Girão
Serrão after conversations on his blog [Egyptian multiplication with
Haskell](https://mathspp.com/blog/egyptian-multiplication).
